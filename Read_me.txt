Hi tutor,
            I have tested the working of this code on the lab computers and the results were as follows,
            1. I tried to run the code in Brackets editor, using the live preview feature but Brackets was unable to start the preview so some unknown reasons.
            2. I tried to run the code in Mozilla Firefox and it ran SUCCESSFULLY.
            3. I tried to run the code in Microsoft Edge browser. The code ran SUCCESSFULLY but had UI differences due to browser differences.
            4. I tried to run in Internet explorer but it did not load the data there.
